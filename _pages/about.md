During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to contribute to several notable projects. One of my papers, "SALMON: A Structure-Aware Language Model with Logicality and Densification Strategy for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning," has been accepted by EMNLP 2024, and I am excited to present it in Miami, USA. Another project, "Joint Framework for Tensor Decomposition-Based Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion," was published in Information Science 2024. This work received recognition with the Best Researcher Award at the International Research Data Analysis Excellence Awards.

To complement my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable industry experience through internships. I have worked with the ERNIE-APP Team at Baidu (January - May 2024), the Muse-LM Team at Tencent Lyra Lab (June - October 2024), and I am currently interning with the GLM-v Team at Zhipu AI (October 2024 - present). These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided insights into real-world applications of NLP technologies.

Looking ahead, I am committed to further exploring the intersection of theoretical advancements and practical applications in the field of NLP. I am always open to collaboration and eager to engage with like-minded researchers and professionals. If you share similar interests or have any opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out!
